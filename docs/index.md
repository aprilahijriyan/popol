Popol is a library that provides as-is tools for use on FastAPI.

This project aims to provide APIs to support your FastAPI projects without breaking existing projects. This is another version of the [Fastack](https://github.com/fastack-dev/fastack) project. Overall the available APIs are not much different from the [Fastack plugins](https://github.com/fastack-dev).
